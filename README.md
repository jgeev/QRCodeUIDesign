.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  border-radius: 5%;
  height: 460px;
  text-align: center;
  max-width: 300px;
  background-color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}

.card {
  width: 19rem;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5%;
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
}
.card-text {
  color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
}
```
